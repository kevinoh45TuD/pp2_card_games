# Card Games

<!--Add opening picture-->

## Intro

The purpose of this project is to create a website where the user can play the card game 'match'.
The goal of this website was to create it using HTML, CSS and JS.
Below I have outlined different design choices, features of the pages
and what things were used to create this website.
