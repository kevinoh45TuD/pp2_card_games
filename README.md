# Card Games

<!--Add opening picture-->

## Intro

The purpose of this project is to create a website where the user can play the card game 'match'.
The goal of this website was to create it using HTML, CSS and JS.
Below I have outlined different design choices, features of the pages
and what things were used to create this website.

## UX

### User Stories

Here I have outlined some user stories of things the user might want from this website.

- As a user, I want to learn about the card game match.
- As a user, I want to play the card game match.
- As a user, I want to restart the game midway.
- As a user, I want to quit the game midway.
- As a user, I want to start a new game when I win.
- As a user, I wantto quit to the home screen when I win.
- As a user, I want to see my score as I'm playing.
- As a user, I want to see previous scores.

### Site Owner Goals

Like with the above section here I have outlined some requirements the site owner might have.

- Attract new users to my site.
- Teach users information about the game.
- Let users play the game.
- Ask users their name and validate it to avoid issues.
- Provide users with functional buttons to help navigate the website.
- Provide users with the ability to restart/quit the game.
- Store and display values relating to user's previous matches.

### Wireframes

I created my wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com)

My initial concept was multiple pages and more focus on other card games.

- [Home page wireframe](/doc-media/wireframe-index.png)
- [Game page wireframe](/doc-media/wireframe-game.png)
- [Info page wireframe](/doc-media/wireframe-info.png)

From wireframe stage to final website the general layout of both the home and game page stayed the same.
The colors of the final website are generally quite similar to that of the wireframe.

The info page concept was removed, instead the information being shortened and put into a modal.
The final website focused more on features and modals.
